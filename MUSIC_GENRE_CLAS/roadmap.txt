To undertake your project on classifying music genres using the provided dataset `music_genre.csv`, and complying with the guidelines outlined, here's a structured roadmap that you can follow:

### Step 1: Setup Your Environment
- **Tools and Libraries**: Ensure you have Python installed along with libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, keras (or TensorFlow), matplotlib, seaborn, and possibly more depending on your needs (e.g., librosa for audio processing).

### Progress 1:setting up enviroment is done---

### Step 2: Data Loading and Preprocessing
- **Load the Data**: Read the `music_genre.csv` file using pandas.
- **Initial Exploration**: Use functions like `describe()`, `info()`, and `head()` to understand the structure and summary of the data.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values by either imputing or dropping them (as per your guidelines to manipulate the dataset). Convert data types if necessary.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extract or create new features that could be relevant for genre classification. Consider transformations like scaling, polynomial features, or interaction terms.
  


### Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Visualizations**: Use seaborn or matplotlib to create plots to visualize distributions of features, relationships between features, and the target variable.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Analyze the correlation between numerical features and the target variable.
  
### Step 4: Feature Selection and Dimensionality Reduction
- **Feature Selection**: Use statistical tests or model-based importance to select relevant features.
- **PCA/t-SNE**: Apply PCA or t-SNE if the dimensionality is too high or to visualize data in reduced dimensions.

### Step 5: Model Building
- **Choose Models**: As per guidelines, use at least two model types from Neural Network, Decision Trees & ensembles, kNN, SVM.
- **Setup Model Framework**: Use scikit-learn for simpler models and Keras/TensorFlow for more complex models like Neural Networks.

### Step 6: Model Training and Tuning
- **Split the Data**: Use train-test split or K-fold cross-validation to evaluate model performance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Utilize tools like GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearch, or KerasTuner to find the best parameters.
- **Callbacks and Regularizations**: Integrate callbacks like Early Stopping, Model Checkpoint in Keras. Use techniques like dropout and batch normalization if using Neural Networks.

### Step 7: Model Evaluation
- **Training and Validation**: Train your models and validate them using a validation set or through cross-validation.
- **Metrics**: Since this is a classification task, track accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

### Step 8: Results Analysis and Visualization
- **Performance Table**: Similar to the provided table, summarize the performance of all models.
- **Error Analysis**: Plot confusion matrices, ROC curves, or any relevant metric to understand where models are failing.
- **Feature Importance**: Visualize feature importances where applicable.

### Step 9: Model Deployment
- **Model Saving/Restoring**: Save your best model using `model.save()` in Keras or `joblib` in scikit-learn.
- **Documentation**: Prepare documentation on how to load and use the model.

### Step 10: Project Report and Submission
- **Write-up**: Document the process, findings, model evaluations, and conclusions.
- **Submission**: Include code, datasets, models, and the project report.

This roadmap is comprehensive and aligns with the requirements of your course project, emphasizing practical application of machine learning techniques and showcasing your ability to use a variety of tools and approaches.

---NOTES ON THE STEPS---
### Step 2 
-Handling Float Columns: The presence of 11 float columns suggests that a significant portion of your data is numerical, which is typical for datasets involving measurements or quantitative data.
 You'll need to check these columns for outliers, proper scaling, or normalization as needed for your analysis or model training.

 Handling Object Columns: The object columns will likely require closer inspection to determine if they need cleaning or transformation. For example, if they contain categorical data,
  you may need to convert them into a more suitable format for modeling, such as using one-hot encoding or label encoding. If they contain text, you might need to apply text preprocessing techniques.

  Next Steps:
Inspect Object Columns: Determine exactly what type of data is stored in each object column and decide on the appropriate preprocessing steps (e.g., converting text to numeric categories, parsing dates, handling mixed types).
Numerical Data Analysis: For the float columns, you might consider plotting histograms or boxplots to visualize distributions and identify any outliers or anomalies.
Memory Optimization: If necessary, consider strategies to reduce memory usage, such as converting data types to more memory-efficient formats (float32, int8, etc.), using categorical types for repetitive string data, or processing data in chunks.
