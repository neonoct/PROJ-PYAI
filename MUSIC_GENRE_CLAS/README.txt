instance_id: Likely an identifier for each record in the dataset.
popularity: Numeric value representing the popularity of a track.
acousticness: Measure of how acoustic a track is.
danceability: Measure of how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements.
duration_ms: Duration of the track in milliseconds.
energy: Measure of intensity and activity.
instrumentalness: Indicates the likelihood that a track contains no vocals.
liveness: Detects the presence of an audience in the recording.
loudness: The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB).
speechiness: Measures the presence of spoken words in a track.
valence: Measure of the musical positiveness conveyed by a track.

1-some songs are in two separate rows for being in two different genres(e.g-Blockhead-Cheer up, You're Not Dead Yet" is both in electronic and jazz)-total 7k
 (also their popularity are different in each instance as well as their genres)
Total songs with multiple genres: 3633

2-2,5k of the songs has empty_field as artist_name
3-5 rows are empty
4-all the song names are valid but some of them are in different Fonts 
5-some of the acousticness is in scientific notation(e.g 4.18e-05) but there is no problem for them they are directly read 
6-no problem seen with danceability
7-some duration_ms is -1 meaning empty cell--5k columns
8-some instrumentalness values are 0(missing data)-15K columns( are they missing or their instrumentalness is just 0 ?)
9-some tempo values are missing ? -5K they are also categorized under object(string) because a part of the data is with '?' normally it should be numerical data(float64)
10-from every label(genre) 5k instances
11-obtained date can be dropped it is probably about on which date the data about that instance is gathered into the dataset
12-valence means how likely is the song to be positive higher the value positiver the song-2 songs have 0 valence

---analyzing duration_ms{Distribution Characteristics:
Central Peak: Most of the track durations are clustered around a central peak, which appears to be around 200,000 to 300,000 milliseconds (200 to 300 seconds). This range likely represents typical song lengths.
Long Tail: There is a long tail extending to the right, up to about 800,000 milliseconds (800 seconds), indicating that there are some tracks significantly longer than the average.
No Negative Values: The updated histogram scale starts from 0 and shows no negative values, providing a more realistic view of the data.
Skewness:
Value of 7.48: The high skewness value (greater than 1) confirms the visual assessment of the distribution being right-skewed. It indicates that the mean of the distribution is greater than the median due to the influence of these very long-duration tracks.
Implications for Data Cleaning:
Given this distribution, here's how to handle the duration_ms field:

Replace Invalid Values: Since you noted that some duration_ms values are -1, indicating missing or incorrect entries, replacing these with the median duration is the most appropriate approach. The median is robust against the influence of the long tail (outliers).}
and i made sure that these were likely to be valid.
---analyzing instrumentalness
to make sure if this analyze was on point and ensures that 0s are valid values in the instrumentalness i asked chatgpt better analyze the effect of output distribution of other features where instrumentalness is 0
{. Instrumentalness Comparison:
The tracks with instrumentalness of 0 form a large subset of the overall data (30% of the entries if we consider 15,001 out of 50,000). This significant proportion suggests that a zero value is common and likely represents tracks with no instrumental content rather than missing data.
2. Other Feature Distributions:
Popularity: The mean popularity of tracks with zero instrumentalness (50.72) is notably higher than the overall average (44.22). This could indicate that non-instrumental tracks tend to be more popular.
Acousticness: These tracks have lower average acousticness (0.213) compared to the overall average (0.306), which aligns with them being less instrumental.
Danceability and Energy: Tracks with zero instrumentalness are more danceable (mean 0.621 vs. 0.558) and have higher energy (mean 0.668 vs. 0.600) than the average, supporting the idea that these tracks are likely more vocal and rhythm-focused.
3. Loudness and Speechiness:
Loudness: Tracks with zero instrumentalness are louder on average (-6.61 dB compared to -9.13 dB overall), which is typical for more commercial, vocal-heavy music.
Speechiness: There's also a higher degree of speechiness (0.135 vs. 0.094) in these tracks, which could be associated with genres that feature more spoken words, like hip-hop or rap.}

---analyzing missing tempo values
With tempo values missing in 5k rows and marked with '?', making the column type as object:

Replace '?' with a numerical placeholder (like NaN) and then convert the column to float.
Impute missing values with a statistical measure (mean or median).

Data Distribution and Imputation Strategy:
The distribution is multimodal, with several key peaks which confirm the presence of groups of songs with similar tempos, often characteristic of specific musical genres or styles.
This distribution supports a genre-specific imputation strategy for missing values, as different genres might have different typical tempos.
For general analysis, imputing missing tempo values using the median or mode of the entire dataset might obscure these nuanced differences between musical styles.

using the genre-specific mode 
This approach allows for more nuanced imputation where missing tempo values are filled in a way that respects the typical tempo characteristics of each genre, 
which could lead to more accurate and meaningful analysis, especially when the tempo could significantly vary between genres.

#####Feature Engineering######

2 new featureas are created - interaction features
Importance of These Features:
Energy and Danceability: The product of these features can help machine learning models recognize patterns where both attributes are important for classifying certain music genres.
Loudness and Energy: This interaction can identify genres where loudness coupled with high energy defines the music style, such as in hard rock, where loud, energetic music is a hallmark.

1 new feature - aggregate feature-
acoustic_instrumental_ratio
High Values: A high ratio indicates that a track is significantly more acoustic than instrumental. This might be characteristic of genres like folk or acoustic blues.
Low Values: Conversely, a low ratio (closer to zero) would suggest that a track is more instrumental, which might be common in genres like electronic or classical music.

2 categories from the existing ones- tempo_category and duration category
--

---Added polynomial 
added polynomial features to the dataset i do not know if it they are useful or not but i will keep them for now, i do not actually know what they do and their purposes might delete them all but 
first they need analysis,i will decide later whether to keep them or delete them and just use the other newly created features or the original ones.

?why did we create these new features
1. Interaction Features
Purpose: To capture the combined effect of two features that might not be apparent when considered separately.
Examples:
energy_danceability: This feature combines energy and danceability to potentially highlight tracks that are both energetic and suitable for dancing. Such a feature could be particularly useful in distinguishing upbeat genres like electronic dance music or pop.
loudness_energy: After scaling loudness to ensure it's comparably weighted against energy, this interaction feature helps to identify tracks that are both loud and full of energy, which might characterize genres such as rock or metal.
2. Aggregate Features
Purpose: To provide a single measure that summarizes multiple aspects of the data.
Example:
acoustic_instrumental_ratio: This ratio helps to differentiate tracks that are more acoustic vs. those that are more instrumental, capturing a fundamental aspect of musical composition that can influence genre. A higher ratio could indicate genres like folk or acoustic jazz, where vocals and acoustic sounds dominate, while a lower ratio might indicate instrumental genres like ambient or electronic.
3. Categorical Binning of Continuous Variables
Purpose: To transform continuous variables into categorical ones, which can simplify the modeling by grouping similar values together and possibly enhancing the interpretability of the modelâ€™s predictions.
Examples:
tempo_category: By categorizing tempo into labeled bins like 'very_slow' to 'extremely_fast', this feature simplifies the continuous nature of tempo into categories that might correlate strongly with certain genres. For example, 'very_fast' tempos might be prevalent in genres like trance or hardcore.
duration_cat: Similar to tempo, categorizing song duration helps to distinguish between songs that are typically shorter (which might be common in pop music) versus longer tracks (which might be more common in classical or progressive genres).

?Specially why did we create polynomial features and what will they do
-Understanding Polynomial Features
Polynomial features are created by taking polynomial combinations of your existing features, which can include squared terms, interaction terms between two different features, and higher-order terms. The primary purpose of these features is to capture non-linear relationships between features that linear models might miss. This can be particularly useful in complex domains like music genre classification, where relationships between variables like tempo, energy, and loudness are not strictly linear.
Model Integration: Incorporate these features into your models and assess their impact on performance. It might be necessary to selectively use only those polynomial features that contribute positively to the performance due to the increased dimensionality and potential for overfitting.
Feature Selection: Given the increased feature space, consider using feature selection techniques to reduce dimensionality and focus on the most informative features. This will help manage model complexity and training time.

#correlation matrix
Key Insights from the Simplified Correlation Matrix
Acousticness and Loudness: There's a strong negative correlation (-0.73) between acousticness and loudness. This suggests that songs with higher acousticness tend to be quieter, which aligns with expectations where more acoustic or classical music styles are generally less loud compared to electronic or rock music.

Energy and Acousticness: Similarly, there's a strong negative correlation (-0.79) between energy and acousticness. Higher energy tracks tend to have lower levels of acousticness, indicating a prevalence of more synthesized or electronically influenced sounds in energetic tracks.

Energy and Loudness: There's a very strong positive correlation (0.84) between energy and loudness. This indicates that louder tracks are generally perceived as more energetic, which is a common characteristic in genres like rock, pop, and electronic dance music.

Danceability and Loudness: A moderate positive correlation (0.39) suggests that tracks that are more danceable tend to also be louder. This might reflect a production style where dance tracks are engineered to be loud to enhance their impact in dance settings.

Valence and Danceability: The correlation (0.43) between valence and danceability indicates that tracks with higher danceability tend to also be more positive in mood (valence). This could suggest a trend where more upbeat and danceable tracks are crafted to evoke happier or more positive emotions.

#Analysis of Correlation Matrix Including Music Genre
Popularity and Genre: There's a moderate positive correlation (0.50) between popularity and the music genre. This might suggest that certain genres are consistently more popular than others within your dataset.

Acousticness and Genre: The correlation between acousticness and the music genre is weakly negative (-0.10), indicating that genres with lower acousticness might be slightly more prevalent or popular, though the correlation is not strong.

Danceability and Genre: There's a moderate positive correlation (0.30) between danceability and genre. This implies that certain genres which are typically more danceable tend to be distinct in your dataset.

Energy and Genre: The correlation here is very weak (0.03), suggesting that energy alone may not be a strong discriminator between genres.

Loudness and Genre: Similar to energy, loudness has a very weak correlation (0.10) with genre, indicating it does not vary significantly across genres.

Speechiness and Genre: The correlation is negligible (0.19), suggesting speechiness is not a key feature in differentiating genres.

Valence and Genre: This shows a very weak correlation (0.08), indicating mood conveyed by valence is not distinct across genres.

Tempo and Genre: With virtually no correlation (-0.02), tempo doesn't appear to be a defining feature of genre in your dataset.

##Recommendations for Further Analysis
Investigate Non-linear Relationships: Since many audio features may have non-linear relationships with the genre, consider using machine learning models that can capture these complexities, such as decision trees, random forests, or neural networks.

Dimensionality Reduction: For visualizing feature influence on genre categorization, consider using techniques like PCA or t-SNE to reduce dimensionality and visualize data in two or three dimensions.
