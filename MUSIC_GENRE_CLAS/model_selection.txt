Given your project requirements and the characteristics of your music genre classification dataset, a combination of different models can help you explore a range of machine learning approaches. Here’s a breakdown of suitable models from the ones listed in your project guidelines:

### 1. Decision Trees & Ensembles
- **Decision Tree**: Start with a simple decision tree model to get a baseline understanding of the feature importance and decision paths.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble of decision trees, which is generally more powerful and robust against overfitting than a single decision tree. It is effective for classification tasks and can handle both numerical and categorical data well.
- **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)**: Advanced ensemble techniques like GBM can provide higher accuracy through the sequential correction of predecessors' errors. XGBoost or LightGBM can be considered here for their speed and performance.

### 2. Neural Networks
- **Simple Feedforward Neural Network**: Begin with a simple architecture to capture nonlinear relationships in the data.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: Though typically used for image processing, CNNs can be effective for sequence data if your features are structured similarly (like spectrograms of audio if used).
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**: If you preprocess your data into sequences (like time series of audio features), RNNs or their variants like LSTM or GRU can be very powerful.

### 3. k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
- **kNN**: A non-parametric method that is simple but can be highly effective, especially if the genres have identifiable "niches" in the feature space. Its performance heavily depends on the feature scaling and the choice of the distance metric.

### 4. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- **SVM**: Works well for high-dimensional data and can be very effective for binary classification. For multi-class problems like yours, consider using one-vs-all or one-vs-one strategies. Tuning its parameters (like C, kernel type, and gamma) can significantly impact performance.

### Model Framework Setup
- **Scikit-learn**: Ideal for implementing decision trees, ensembles, kNN, and SVM. It offers robust implementations and easy-to-use interfaces.
- **Keras/TensorFlow**: Best for building neural network models, providing flexibility in architecture design and the ability to scale with GPU acceleration.

### Strategy for Model Selection
1. **Baseline Models**: Start with simpler models like decision trees and kNN to establish a performance baseline.
2. **Complex Models**: Move on to more complex models like neural networks and SVM. Ensure you perform feature scaling especially for kNN and SVM.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Utilize tools like GridSearchCV for traditional ML models and Keras Tuner for neural networks to optimize your models.
4. **Validation**: Use cross-validation techniques to validate your models reliably.

### Example: Neural Network with Keras
Here’s a simple example of setting up a neural network for your task using Keras:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Dropout

model = Sequential([
    Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)),
    Dropout(0.5),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.5),
    Dense(len(genres), activation='softmax')  # 'genres' should be the list of genre labels
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.summary()
```

This setup includes dropout for regularization and a softmax output layer for multi-class classification. Adjust the architecture based on your specific data characteristics and results from initial tests.

Proceeding with these models should give you a comprehensive view of different approaches and their effectiveness on your dataset.
